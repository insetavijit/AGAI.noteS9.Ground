## **Chapter 1 — Foundations**

Core mental models and internals every serious Python developer must master.

|Concept|Brief Description (15–25 words)|
|---|---|
|**Python Philosophy (PEP 20)**|Guiding principles shaping Python’s readability, explicitness, and simplicity. Foundation for writing clean, predictable code.|
|**Interpreted vs Compiled**|How Python executes through bytecode and the PVM, influencing performance and debugging strategy.|
|**Dynamic Typing**|Flexible typing system allowing late binding and rapid prototyping with trade-offs.|
|**First-class Functions**|Functions treated as objects enabling callbacks, decorators, and functional composition.|
|**DRY / SOLID / Composition**|Maintainable architecture patterns focused on clarity, reuse, and modular extensibility.|
|**Duck Typing**|Behaviors matter more than types, enabling polymorphism without inheritance.|
|**Mutable vs Immutable**|Implications for performance, hashing, side effects, and safe concurrency.|
|**LEGB Scope**|Rule governing where variables live and resolve during execution.|
|**Iterators & Generators**|Lazy evaluation powering efficient iteration and async pipelines.|
|**Object Model & MRO**|How Python resolves attributes, inheritance order, and metaclass customization.|
|**CPython / GIL / GC**|Interpreter internals impacting multi-threading, memory usage, and performance tuning.|
|**Source → Bytecode → PVM**|Data flow from code to execution through parsing, compiling, and evaluation.|
|**Python 3.13+ Modern Features**|Free-threaded mode, experimental JIT, improved REPL, and type system evolution.|

If you'd like, next step options:

### **What should we do next?**

1. Create concept tables _chapter by chapter_
    
2. Add **micro-projects and exercises** per concept
    
3. Build **flashcards & active recall deck**
    
4. Convert to **Obsidian vault format**
    
5. Turn into **Notion / PDF / printable study system**
    

Which direction first?
