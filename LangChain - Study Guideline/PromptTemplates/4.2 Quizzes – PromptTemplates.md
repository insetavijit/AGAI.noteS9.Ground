##### 1. What is the primary purpose of a PromptTemplate?

a) To store documents b) To create structured prompts with variables  
c) To train a model   d) To replace embeddings

**Explanation (25 words):**  
PromptTemplates create structured prompts with placeholders, enabling dynamic variable injection and consistent formatting. They reduce repetition, prevent errors, and ensure predictable outputs across different tasks.

---

##### 2. What does `{topic}` represent inside a prompt template?

a) A function       b) A variable placeholder  
c) A fixed keyword  d) A formatting error

**Explanation (25 words):**  
`{topic}` is a dynamic placeholder replaced at runtime. It enables templates to stay reusable, flexible, and capable of adapting outputs based on user input.

---

##### 3. Which method creates a PromptTemplate in LangChain?

a) PromptTemplate.run()  
b) PromptTemplate.from_template()  
c) PromptTemplate.add()  
d) PromptTemplate.use()

**Explanation (25 words):**  
`from_template()` constructs PromptTemplates from text containing variables. It detects variable names, sets up structure, and prepares the template for dynamic rendering.

---

##### 4. Why are PromptTemplates better than writing raw prompts?

a) Faster to compile  
b) Support variable injection & reusability  
c) Generate embeddings  
d) Reduce model size

**Explanation (25 words):**  
Templates enforce consistency, allow dynamic inputs, reduce prompt drift, and simplify multi-step workflows. They make prompting more reliable and predictable across repeated use.

---

##### 5. What happens if your template includes a missing variable?

a) It’s ignored  
b) Error occurs  
c) Model guesses value  
d) Replaced with blank

**Explanation (25 words):**  
Missing variables cause rendering errors because every placeholder must be filled. This prevents incomplete prompts and ensures properly formatted instructions reach the model.

##### 1. Which inputs are required for:

“Rewrite the text with a {tone} tone for a {audience} audience.”  
a) tone only  
b) audience only  
c) both  
d) neither

**Explanation (25 words):**  
Both variables are required. LangChain enforces strict variable matching to avoid rendering failures and ensure fully structured, context-aware instructions reach the LLM.

---

##### 2. What is the main benefit of chaining PromptTemplates?

a) Faster inference  
b) Single-move transformation  
c) Multi-stage controlled transformation  
d) Produces JSON

**Explanation (25 words):**  
Chaining allows multi-step processing with cleanup, structuring, refinement, and formatting. It increases control, reduces ambiguity, and improves output consistency.

---

##### 3. Which stage usually comes first in a refinement pipeline?

a) Format  
b) Structure  
c) Cleanup  
d) Tone adjustment

**Explanation (25 words):**  
Cleanup comes first because removing noise and formatting issues ensures all later stages operate on normalized, error-free input for more precise transformations.

---

##### 4. Which is a sign your template needs debugging?

a) Output is very short  
b) Variables work correctly  
c) Model ignores a defined section  
d) Template uses markdown

**Explanation (25 words):**  
If the model consistently ignores a section, the structure or instructions are unclear. Tighten headings, constraints, or formatting to restore reliable behavior.

---

##### 5. Which practice improves predictability of template outputs?

a) Using vague instructions  
b) Avoiding sample formats  
c) Providing strict structured sections  
d) Using emojis

**Explanation (25 words):**  
Providing strict structure and explicit formatting boundaries reduces model freedom, resulting in stable, predictable outputs across different inputs.

##### 1. In a 4-stage pipeline, which failure shows broken output handoff?

a) Final answer is too short  
b) Stage 3 references vanished text  
c) Model outputs JSON  
d) Pipeline is too fast

**Explanation (25 words):**  
If later stages reference missing content, earlier steps removed or altered text incorrectly. Each stage must pass complete, intact output to the next.

---

##### 2. Template has `{analysis}` and `{summary}` but user provides only analysis. How to avoid errors?

a) Fill missing with empty strings  
b) Add conditional blocks  
c) Remove `{summary}`  
d) Ask user again

**Explanation (25 words):**  
Conditional logic allows templates to adapt when inputs are missing. This prevents rendering errors while preserving structure and workflow stability.

---

##### 3. A template keeps causing hallucinations. Best fix?

a) Add a quote  
b) Add strict format + required sections  
c) Increase temperature  
d) Remove constraints

**Explanation (25 words):**  
Hallucinations decrease when prompts include strict skeletal structure, which limits unnecessary creativity and forces the model into precise, constrained output behavior.

---

##### 4. You want a specific table format. Best approach?

a) Tell LLM “create a nice table”  
b) Provide a strict table skeleton  
c) Let model choose layout  
d) Use natural language only

**Explanation (25 words):**  
Models follow strict structural guidance best. Providing a complete table skeleton ensures consistent formatting and prevents invented or distorted layouts.

---

##### 5. What ensures maximum pipeline stability?

a) One giant template  
b) Many atomic templates chained  
c) No templates  
d) Creative instructions

**Explanation (25 words):**  
Small, atomic templates chained together create predictable, debuggable steps. Each stage does one task, reducing complexity and improving stability.
