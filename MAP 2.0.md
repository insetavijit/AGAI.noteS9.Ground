## 8. OPTIMIZATION METRICS

Track these to improve:
- Time to basic competence: [target: X weeks]
- Time to production-ready: [target: Y weeks]
- Quiz scores over time (should trend up)
- Retention after 30/60/90 days
- Confidence ratings (1-10 scale)

Adjust study plan if:
- Score < 70% → Slow down, review foundations
- Score 70-85% → Current pace is good
- Score > 85% → Can accelerate or increase difficulty

---

# SUCCESS INDICATORS

I'll know I've mastered this when I can:
- ✅ Recall core concepts without reference after 30+ days
- ✅ Explain to others in simple terms
- ✅ Apply in novel situations without guidance
- ✅ Identify and fix errors independently
- ✅ Make informed trade-off decisions
- ✅ Continue learning without external structure

---

# ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI:

1. **Adapt to subject type**: If it's a language, focus on conversation practice. If it's theory, focus on understanding principles. If it's technical skills, focus on hands-on projects.

2. **Scale appropriately**: For simple topics (e.g., "Git basics"), make this concise. For complex topics (e.g., "Machine Learning"), expand each section.

3. **Make it actionable**: Every section should have clear next steps, not just information.

4. **Include examples**: Use real examples, not placeholders like "[example here]".

5. **Progressive complexity**: Ensure each level genuinely builds on the previous one.

6. **Cognitive load awareness**: Don't overwhelm with too many concepts per session. Stick to 5-7 new items maximum.

7. **Use the Feynman principle**: Explain things simply enough that a motivated beginner could follow.

8. **Practical focus**: Prioritize what I'll actually use over comprehensive theory.

## PRO TIPS:

✅ **Be specific** with your subject - "Machine Learning" is too broad, "Supervised Learning with Scikit-learn" is better

✅ **Honest about level** - Overestimating leads to frustration, underestimating wastes time

✅ **Clear goal** - "Learn Python" vs "Build a web scraper to automate my workflow"

✅ **Realistic time** - Be honest about your schedule for better pacing

✅ **Iterate** - Generate, use for a week, then regenerate with feedback on what worked/didn't
