# **4. ACTIVE RECALL**

Active recall transforms knowledge from temporary familiarity into permanent, instantly usable skill. This section focuses on retrieval practice, spaced repetition, challenge-based learning, and memory reinforcement—ensuring concepts evolve from passive understanding to expert-level automatic recall used in real engineering and high-pressure interview environments.
