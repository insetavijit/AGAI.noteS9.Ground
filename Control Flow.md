## [[Control Flow]]

## 🧠 Overview (Mentor Advice)

When mastering control flow, think less about syntax and more about directing program behavior with intention. A skilled developer uses control flow to make software adaptable, predictable, and resilient under changing runtime conditions. Focus on clarity, avoid deeply nested logic, and choose the simplest structure that expresses decisions, repetition, and error recovery. Treat control flow as the architecture of how your logic breathes—organize your steps deliberately, anticipate edge cases, and ensure the execution path is readable for future maintainers.

## 📋 Topics Table (Clickable Wiki-Style)

|Topic|Brief Description|
|---|---|
|**[[if / elif / else]]**|Conditional decision structures that evaluate boolean expressions to control execution flow based on runtime data. They enable programs to react intelligently to different states, validate conditions, route logic paths, and eliminate hard-coded assumptions, forming the foundation for dynamic and context-driven behavior.|
|**[[Loops (for / while)]]**|Loops repeat code blocks, enabling structured iteration over sequences or condition-controlled repetition. They automate repetitive tasks, process streaming or large datasets, and build algorithmic steps without duplication. Proper loop design ensures performance, prevent infinite runs, and supports maintainable workflow cycles.|
|**[[Break / Continue / Pass]]**|Loop control statements that manipulate internal execution paths. `break` stops loop execution immediately, `continue` jumps to the next cycle without finishing the current block, and `pass` holds structure without action. They improve clarity, reduce complexity, and enable expressive, intention-focused looping logic.|
|**[[Match – Case (Pattern Matching)]]**|A modern structural control system that matches dynamic patterns instead of simple values. It handles multiple branching conditions more cleanly than long conditional chains, supporting cleaner routing, complex data structure decomposition, command dispatching, and flexible decision architecture.|
|**[[Exceptions (try / except / finally / raise)]]**|A structured mechanism for managing runtime failures without crashing applications. It isolates risky operations, enables graceful recovery, ensures resource cleanup, improves reliability, and separates normal logic from error handling for cleaner architecture and professional-grade defensive programming.|
|**[[Assertions (assert)]]**|Assertions verify assumptions within code and immediately signal unexpected states. They help catch logical errors early, reinforce contractual programming, support testing and debugging phases, and maintain internal consistency by ensuring code behaves exactly as intended during execution.|
|**[[Return & Flow Termination]]**|Explicit control over when and how a function ends and what value it outputs. Enables modular design, predictability, multi-path computation, performance optimization, and clear separation of responsibilities by managing the exact moment computation should conclude.|
|**[[Recursion]]**|A control technique where a function repeatedly calls itself to solve problems in progressively smaller components. Ideal for hierarchical structures such as trees, graphs, search algorithms, and mathematical sequences, balancing elegant logic expression with careful termination design.|
|**[[Generators & yield]]**|A lazy evaluation control system that produces values one at a time only when needed. Reduces memory load, supports streaming workflows, enables efficient processing of large or infinite sequences, and powers asynchronous pipelines and advanced architecture patterns where performance matters.|
